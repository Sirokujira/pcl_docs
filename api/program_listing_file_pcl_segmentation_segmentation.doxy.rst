     \section secSegmentationPresentation Overview
       The <b>pcl_segmentation</b> library contains algorithms for segmenting a point cloud into distinct clusters.
       These algorithms are best suited to processing a point cloud that is composed of a number of spatially isolated 
       regions.  In such cases, clustering is often used to break the cloud down into its constituent parts, which can 
       then be processed independently.
